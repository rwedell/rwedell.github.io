If you're ready for some real excitement, and real excitement to you is reading grad school capstone projects about data analysis and COVID modeling, THEN YOU ARE IN LUCK. I worked on this project for 
credit as part of my masters degree at UTC. It was actually a little interesting and fun to work on too though. The gist of it was creating different models, visualizing how different strains of 
COVID spread in different parts of the world, and measuring the differences and similarities. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16UtybzUkMNphw0nW_DzI7nYSmxf-9M8t/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">Here's a link to the final project paper</a>. I did this data analysis in python mostly using pandas for data stuff and plotly for visualizations. <a href="https://github.com/rwedell/covid" target="_blank">Here are the notebooks</a>.

I worked on this project as a part of our Chattalytics program in the Performance Management and Open Data Office in the city. The goal was to develop a decision support tool to help prioritize fire inspections done by the Chattanooga Fire Department. To do this, I developed a machine learning model based on previous fire calls and parcel attributes. I also combined this with non predictive variables to add more context to the tool and better assist the decision making of the fire department.

This is a project I worked on for a class focussed on analyzing big data using Hadoop. Chattanooga historically had poor air quality, and I wanted to see how air quality had changed over time in the region. To do this, I used the <a href="https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html" target="_blank">EPA’s Air Quality System API</a> to download the data. I then used Hive, Spark, and Hadoop to analyze data. To help answer and explain the project questions I used Plotly for data visualization. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kwhTVHLFMMaLD9SxioBASqBkBA54-OaM/view" target="_blank">Here’s a link</a> to the project paper I wrote for more information on the project.

I used the <a href ="https://www.chattadata.org/stories/s/7j3y-7jke" target="blank">dashboard here</a> to track my daily work and make sure that data is successfully flowing into the city’s data warehouse. The section I check everyday is the job log timeline. Workflows are used to update datasets nightly, and these visuals display how many workflows were successful <a href ="https://www.chattadata.org/dataset/Automated-Job-Log-Timeline/g2q3-pr3e" target="blank">each day</a> or <a href ="https://www.chattadata.org/dataset/Automated-Job-Log-Timeline-Monthly-View/3727-expe" target="blank">each month</a> . I started with the city in November 2018 if you want to see how I did in my time there.
